/**
 * OCP: Closed for modification, open for extension.
 *
 * New rules are added by implementing EligibilityRule and passing them in —
 * this class never needs to change when new rules are introduced.
 *
 * The original if/else chain used short-circuit evaluation (stop at first
 * failure).
 * That behaviour is preserved here: we stop at the first failing rule so the
 * output remains identical.
